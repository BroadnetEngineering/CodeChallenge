# Broadnet Code Challenge
We use code challenges to assess programming skill. You are free to pick from any of the following code challenges:

* [Simple Todo List](https://github.com/BroadnetEngineering/TodoList "Simple Todo List")
* [Polling Application](https://github.com/BroadnetEngineering/PollingApp "Polling App")
* [Event Application](https://github.com/BroadnetEngineering/EventApp "Event App")
* Or, do something else of your choosing. Just follow the rules below and submit your PR to this repo!

### Rules - Not Much!
* Use MySQL if appropriate, include schema necessary to run your code
* We want to be able to run your submission, not just look at the code

### Submissions
* Submit your code as a PR to the repo of the project you chose
